# Toby-s_Escape-PyGame-Project

Small retro indie PyGame made for an MSc (20/21) project. Jump to survive, beat your hi-score

Smaller than other projects in the year as it was a 3-person project I did on my own without a group. Sadly my father passed away at the start of the project and I wasn't able to be part of a team. However, this project did still achieve a 70 (First).

NOTE: There is level music but sadly too big to upload to git - may be some issues/bugs running the game without these being in any code pulls.
