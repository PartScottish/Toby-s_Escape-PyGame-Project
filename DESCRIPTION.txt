Where sunshine and friendships once filled the kingdom, where cities grew tall and prosperous and the land green and full, a dragon watched from the shadows as the guile and greed of people grew. He watched as cities endlessly grew and leached all the beauty of natural flora and fauna from the land; biding his rage and grief. Until one day, when the unending greed of people arrived at his cave. Their great machines whirring, they began to chip at the rocks and gems of his beautiful cave. He arose, wrathful and strong. His great wings beat the people off the mountain, his great claws wrenched their machines apart, and his terrible roar buried their great castles and cities deep, deep into the earth. 

Years later, one great adventurer, Toby, the burried cityâ€™s last hope, took it upon himself to save his people from the darkness of the depths and began his great journey up to the now great unknown. Will there be light at the end of his journey? Will there be safety at the top of the perilous tower or be greeted by the dragon's unrelenting indignation? Will he find the sunlight and the surface to save his people or is the sun and the sky destroyed too?

Using only falling stones and his own sheer strength Toby makes his way up the tower brick by brick, platform by platform. He may fall, but he picks himself back up again every time to get further and further from safety and closer to success.

How far can you, as Toby, make it up the tower surpassing those that have come before Toby? Rumour has it a previous adventure managed to climb to the dizzying heights of 11205 score in their efforts to bring back a future for the people of the kingdom.
